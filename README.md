### Recent task break down ###


22. add a overlay spinner that happens in every blocking API load
23. so here is how it works, we place a in page spinner if we still allow user to do anything else while loading this api call. If they are not allow to do anythign else, we place a full screen spinner which is a overlay that covers entire page.
17.1. pass in browser default language

24. check all the api calls and redefine the method
23. you need to support multi-language, so in all the forms, you can only validate whether a string has invalid character, instead allow it only to be  alphabetic characters only.
24. for security, double check everything you receive user input!!!! we can do it later.
- need to work on account pages
- need to double check all action workflow when start building api
26. we should add a username field so that user can login with either his email address or username
27. create another file with all the const value of server error type, so that you can keep track of them.
! make things easier for user, not for programmer.
